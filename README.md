POC of timetable4hk
-------------------

System Requirement: HTML5 browser.

`calendar.html` is the main page that shows the calendar. It can be hosted on any HTTP server.

`eventhk2ics.html` and `legco2ics.html` are the UI to call the upstream data sources.

To use `eventhk2ics.html` and `legco2ics.html`, you need node.js to run the proxy server.

`node proxy.node.js` and port 8888 will be listening.
